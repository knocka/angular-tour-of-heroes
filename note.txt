i i run to similar issue with you.

While i'm not sure how to properly fix this issue but let me share my workaround.

First.
You may want to update your SHELL env var by pointing it to your git bash location.
export SHELL="/c/Program Files/Git/bin/bash"
change the path to where your git bash location.

If up until this point you succeed then no need to change anything else. If not (I'm not). Then there is a problem in path resolve process. when you look deep inside spawn-default-shell/src/get-shell.js Node Modules they are trying to compare our SHELL path with common shell regex.
const DETECT_SH_REGEX = /sh$/;
that variable assume that all shell name must end with "sh" while in our case it turns out to be
C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
which means ends with "sh.exe" then it trows an error.

so the solution is change
const DETECT_SH_REGEX = /sh$/;
to
const DETECT_SH_REGEX = /sh/;

Hope that helps, pardon me if i wrongly explain something.
